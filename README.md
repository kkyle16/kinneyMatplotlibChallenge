Matplotlib Challenge

### Pymaceuticals

This challenge dealt with plotting the effects of drug treatment on mice. I was provided with two csv files and was tasked with merging them, creating various plots using pandas and pyplot.

### Observations

1) Capomulin was effective in gradually reducing the tumor volume over the given time period. The decline was steady and ended up reducing the tumor size by about 20% on average. 

2) Weight is weakly correlated with tumor volume in Capomulin mice. While heavier mice tend to only have heavier tumors, lighter mice had a wide variety of tumor sizes. 

3) Ramicane and Capomulin were the only two drugs to finish with a mean tumor volume below the starting tumor volume. All other drugs finished with a volume relatively close to the that of the Placebo and seem ineffective in general.
